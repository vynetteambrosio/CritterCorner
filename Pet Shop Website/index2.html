                              <p>Pets, especially dogs and cats, can reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, ease loneliness,
                                 encourage exercise and playfulness, and even improve your cardiovascular health. Caring
                                 for an animal can help children grow up more secure and active. Pets also provide
                                 valuable companionship for older adults.</p>
